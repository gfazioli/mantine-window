import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-window" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-window/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-window` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-window/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-window/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

The `Window` component allows you to create draggable and resizable windows within your application. It provides a familiar desktop-like experience for users. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the windows using various props. Also, you can choose whether the window should be rendered within a portal or relative to its parent container using the `withinPortal` prop.

> **Note:** 
>
> Usually, you would want to use the `Window` component within a portal to avoid layout issues. However, if you want the window to be constrained within a specific container, you can set the `withinPortal` prop to `false` and the container should have `position: relative` style. 
>
> For example, in the demos below, the `Window` component is rendered relative to its parent container which has `position: relative` style.
