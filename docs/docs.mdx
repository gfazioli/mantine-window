import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-json-tree` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

The `JsonTree` is interactive JSON tree viewer component built with [Mantine's Tree component](https://mantine.dev/core/tree/). Features collapsible nodes, syntax highlighting with type-specific colors, copy-to-clipboard functionality, item count badges, configurable expansion depth, and smooth animations. Perfect for debugging API responses, exploring complex data structures, and developer tools.

## Syntax Highlighting values

Below is an example of syntax highlighting for different JSON value types: strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, objects, and arrays. Each type is displayed in a distinct color for better readability.

<Demo data={demos.values} />

## Indent Guides

Display vertical lines to visualize nesting levels, similar to Visual Studio Code. The guides use 5 distinct colors that cycle for deeper nesting levels.

## Sticky Header

You may enable sticky headers for better context when scrolling through large JSON structures. When enabled, the header of each expanded node remains visible at the top of the scrollable area as you navigate through its child elements. You can also set an offset to accommodate fixed headers in your layout.

## Icons

You can customize the expand/collapse icons used in the `JsonTree` component by providing your own icons via the `expandControlIcon` and `collapseControlIcon` props. The default icons are simple chevrons, but you can replace them with any React component or icon of your choice.

> Note: If only the `expandControlIcon` is provided, the component will automatically use it for both expand and collapse states, by rotating (90deg) it accordingly. If only the `collapseControlIcon` is provided, the default expand icon will be used. Of course, you can provide both icons for complete customization.

## Style the component with classNames

You can style the `JsonTree` component using the `classNames` prop to target specific inner elements. This allows for granular customization of the component's appearance.

## Styles API

`JsonTree` supports [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/), you can add styles to any inner element of the component with `classNames` prop. Follow [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/) documentation to learn more.

You can customize the appearance of the `JsonTree` component using the Styles API. This allows you to modify styles for various parts of the component, such as keys, values, brackets, and more.
